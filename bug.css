The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if you are not careful with operator precedence and unit usage.  For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely cause unexpected behavior because '10' is missing units. Another subtle issue is that spaces around the operators within `calc()` are required. Using `width:calc(100%-10px)` is incorrect.
